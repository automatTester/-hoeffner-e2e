/**
 * Bit of a hack to send the java.util.logging (JUL) output to Slf4J. Since Guice is
 * guaranteed to run (from cli, maven, test-runner in IDE, etc) even though
 * this class does not actually inject anything via Guice, it is useful to
 * configure JUL. This LogModule was considered cleaner than adding a static
 * method somewhere.
 * <p>
 * <br/>Other options require command line settings, which becomes cumbersome.
 * <p>
 * <br/>Even a Cucumber plugin would not always run, e.g. when users launch
 * from an IDE.
 * <p>
 * <br/>Note that ChromeDriver (as a non-java binary) will still send
 * output to stderr.
